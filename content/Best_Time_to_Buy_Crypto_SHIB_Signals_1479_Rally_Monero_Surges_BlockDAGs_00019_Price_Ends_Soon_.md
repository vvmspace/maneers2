# Best Time to Buy Crypto? SHIB Signals 1,479% Rally, Monero Surges

Sudden price surges often spark debates, but they rarely come with clear conclusions. **Monero’s sharp 21% jump** in just one hour has left analysts guessing, while **Shiba Inu (SHIB)** bullish momentum continues to build. Still, beyond the headlines, investors are increasingly focusing on projects that show real user involvement and long-term strategy.

## Monero (XMR) Price Jumps 21% in One Hour

The **Monero (XMR)** price stunned the market with a **21% rise** in just 60 minutes, reaching **$311.62**. This one-hour spike pushed its weekly gains to **44.01%**, with daily trading volume jumping **194.40%** to **$158.71 million**. Still, there’s no confirmed reason behind the sudden move, leaving the market to speculate. Some believe it’s rising interest in privacy coins, while others point to large investor moves.

What’s certain is Monero’s tech appeal hasn’t faded. Its advanced privacy tools continue to attract users who value anonymity. As social platforms fill up with theories, the real trigger behind this rally remains unclear. 

## Shiba Inu (SHIB) Bullish Momentum Builds

**Shiba Inu (SHIB) bullish momentum** is starting to turn heads. After closing its third straight green week, SHIB appears to be breaking out of a prolonged consolidation. One analyst suggests this trend shift could lead to a strong upward rally, possibly reaching new highs.

## BlockDAG $0.0019 Price to End on May 13

BlockDAG is hinting at a major exchange listing announcement coming on **May 13**. It’s offering BDAG coins at **$0.0019** until then, marking a massive markdown from the current batch price of **$0.0262**. This limited offer puts a timer on the opportunity.
