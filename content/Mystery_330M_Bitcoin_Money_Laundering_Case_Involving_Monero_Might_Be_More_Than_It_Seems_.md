# Mystery $330M Bitcoin Money Laundering Case Involving Monero Might Be More Than It Seems

A shadowy hacker’s $330 million Bitcoin heist has ignited chaos in cryptocurrency markets, triggering a jaw-dropping 50% surge in privacy token **Monero (XMR)** and experts suspect a brazen plot to amplify profits through derivatives. Here’s how the saga unfolded.  

## A Dormant Wallet Awakens Then Disappears

On April 27, 2025, a Bitcoin wallet inactive for eight years suddenly moved 3,520 BTC ($330.7 million). Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT flagged the transaction as suspicious, tracing it to an “OG Bitcoiner” likely robbed of their fortune. The stolen funds were split across 100+ wallets, then funneled through instant exchanges like FixedFloat. But instead of cashing out via stablecoins, the hacker chose **Monero**, a privacy coin notorious for untraceable transactions.

Monero’s price skyrocketed 45% within hours, hitting $391. Yet data reveals a deeper scheme: open interest in **XMR** derivatives doubled to $35.1 million, hinting at a calculated play to profit twice, first from laundering, then from markets.

## The Monero Pump: Liquidity Crisis or Master Plan?

Monero’s limited liquidity made it a volatile target. With just $1 million in market depth per 2% price swing, the hacker’s massive XMR buys caused instant chaos. Slippage likely erased $66 million from their haul, but derivatives data tells a different story.

While spot prices surged 45%, open interest in futures and options leaped 107%, far beyond natural growth. Analysts estimate $11 million in pre-positioned long bets capitalized on the rally. “This wasn’t random,” said a CoinDesk trader. “Someone knew the pump was coming.”

## How the Hack May Have Paid Twice

Here’s the twist: The hacker possibly offset losses by gambling on XMR’s rise. Before swapping BTC to XMR, they could have opened leveraged long positions on derivatives platforms. With 10x leverage, a 50% price jump would yield 500% returns, turning $11 million into $55 million.

Meanwhile, Monero’s privacy features masked the stolen funds, while derivatives profits flowed through cleaner channels. This mirrors past schemes: In 2022, Avi Eisenberg manipulated Mango Markets via price oracle exploits, netting $114 million before facing prison.

## Why Monero? Privacy, Profit, and Low Stakes

Critics question why the hacker chose XMR over mixers like Tornado Cash. The answer? Control. Monero’s stealth addresses and ring signatures erase transaction trails, but its thin liquidity also lets large players manipulate prices.

Exchanges have delisted XMR in various regions, further squeezing liquidity. By exploiting this, the hacker turned a privacy tool into a profit engine, crashing markets on the way out. By Monday evening, XMR had tumbled to $295, leaving retail traders scrambling.

## Echoes of JELLY

This isn’t new. In April 2024, a trader pumped JELLY tokens on illiquid exchanges, fooling pricing oracles to boost derivatives on HyperLiquid. Similarly, the XMR attacker likely bought spot to inflate futures in a “pump-and-dump” with extra steps.

“These schemes prey on low liquidity,” said blockchain analyst Clara Wright. “They buy spot, ride the derivatives wave, then vanish. It’s rinse-and-repeat for sophisticated criminals.”

## Regulators Circle as Privacy Coins Face Heat

The hack intensifies scrutiny on privacy coins. While groups like Lazarus favor Bitcoin, Monero’s anonymity lured this thief. The ECB has pressured exchanges to drop XMR, and the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Tornado Cash in 2022.

Yet regulation lags. Instant exchanges operate in grey zones, letting hackers swap coins swiftly. Until liquidity tightens or laws catch up, experts warn such heists will persist.

## A Perfect Storm of Greed and Anonymity

The $330M heist reveals crypto’s dark underbelly: a playground where hackers exploit privacy tech and market flaws to double profits. While ZachXBT tracks the stolen BTC’s path, Monero’s privacy guarantees may shield the thief forever.

For investors, the lesson is clear. Low-liquidity assets like XMR remain hunting grounds for manipulators. As regulators scramble, one truth emerges: where there’s anonymity and leverage, there’s opportunity for chaos.
